Sync data into your local data warehouse

```python title="scripts/etl/sync_airtable_dwh.py"
from arkalos.data.extractors.airtable_extractor import AirtableExtractor
from arkalos.workflows.etl_workflow import ETLWorkflow

wf = ETLWorkflow(AirtableExtractor)
wf.run(drop_tables=True)
```

Run an AI agent locally and talk to your data

```python title="scripts/ai/dwh_agent.py"
from arkalos.ai.agents import DWHAgent

agent = DWHAgent()
agent.run()
```

Whether you're analyzing data, building AI agents, or training LLMs, Arkalos makes it easy and enjoyable.

The name Arkalos combines "Arc" and the Greek word "Kalos," meaning "a beautiful journey through the data."

## Modern Python Workflow, Ready Out-of-the-Box

Arkalos makes it easy to get started, whether you're a non-coder, scientist, or AI engineer.

No more struggling with:

* Setting up your environment
* Manually installing and managing packages
* Writing too much code for basic tasks
* Resolving import issues and errors
* Figuring out how to structure custom code and modules
* Growing from Jupyter Notebooks to full AI apps and pipelines

## Truly Open-Source, Local, and Compliant

Arkalos helps individuals and businesses analyze data securely, with everything running locally and fully compliant with regulations.




## Free Built-In Configuration, Data Warehouse and Integrations

Data warehouses are centralized repositories that connect multiple data sources to enable AI and analytics.

Not every case needs complex and expensive tools like Snowflake or BigQuery. With Arkalos, you get a simple, local data warehouse right out of the box!

Arkalos connects seamlessly to popular tools like Notion, Airtable, Google Drive, and HubSpot.

Automatically detects and generates the schema.

And syncs data into your own data warehouse.

```python title="config/data_sources.py"
    'airtable': {
        'enabled': True,
        'api_key': env('AIRTABLE_API_KEY'),
        'base_id': env('AIRTABLE_BASE_ID'),
        'tables': env('AIRTABLE_TABLES'),
    }
```

SQLite is used as the default local data warehouse.

```ini title=".env"
DWH_ENGINE=SQLite
DWH_SCHEMA_PATH=data/dwh/schema.sql
DWH_SQLITE_PATH=data/dwh/dwh.db
```

```python
uv run arkalos dwh sync
```

And that's it! Your data is imported automatically, ready for analysis or AI pipelines, and even accessible offline.





## Launch a Python Data or AI Microservice

Python is the world's fastest-growing programming language thanks to its rich ecosystem of data, AI, and scientific libraries.

Arkalos lets freelancers, consultants, startups, businesses, and even governments add powerful data and AI capabilities to their products and platforms. Simply launch Arkalos as a microservice and integrate it seamlessly into your architecture.
